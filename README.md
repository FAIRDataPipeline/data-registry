The SCRC data registry is a Django website and REST API which is used by the data-pipeline to store metadata about code runs and their inputs and outputs.

User documentation is available [here](docs/index.md).

Information on how to run the local registry is available at [https://fairdatapipeline.github.io/docs/local_registry/](https://fairdatapipeline.github.io/docs/local_registry/).

Alternativley you can run the local registry in a local VM using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) with the included Vagrantfile.
