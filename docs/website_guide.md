## Authentication

You can register on the website using the `Log in or sign up using GitHub` link. This will ask
for you to authorise the SCRC registry application with your GitHub account.

## Admin

Once you have logged in using GitHub OAuth authentication you will now have an account on the
website and can request admin access. A user with superuser credentials can modify your user
account to give you `staff` status and privileges to modify `data_registry` objects.
